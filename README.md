Hi Team Zeeto!

I've completed the PHP Ninja tast.  This is my first time working in Symfony2 / Doctrine2, 
so it was definitely a fun and challenging task. I've enjoy it tremendously!

Before you run the Ninja test, please update your tables that include my phptest.sql which 
contain the new "logged_api_calls" table. Next, to run the PHP Ninja test, place the symfony 
folder in your localhost directory or web server, launch your browser, and goto 

http://localhost/ninja

I managed to complete all but one of the extra credit involve making the API sending and 
executable CLI script that may be set to CRON.

Thanks for the PHP Ninja Challenge! Looking forward to hearing from you.


Rodney Nguyen.
